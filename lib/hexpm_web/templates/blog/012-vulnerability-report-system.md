# Vulnerability report system.

Today we announce the Vulnerability Report System, which will allow users to keep track of security reports on Hex packages.

Users will be able to **submit package reports** through a form accessible from the package page.  A detailed description of the vulnerability should be provided as well as any information that might help moderators to recognize it. An affected release field has also been provided, so the users can specify the range of releases affected by the vulnerability.

After the report has been submitted it will be published and a **revision process** will begin.  Along this process the report will go through multiple states, to allow different types of users to participate in the vulnerability tracking.

On each state the users involved on the revision process might have or not access to the report depending on their roles. For instance, a package owner will not have access to a report on his package until it has not been reviewed and accepted by the moderators. Moderators, package owners and the report author will even have access to a **comments section** once the report has been accepted.

We have also configured some **e-mail notifications** so moderators, package owners and the report author get informed on relevant state changes or when new someone makes new comments.
